<h2>My top 5 movies of all the time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Om Shanti Om</h3>
<p>Om Shanti Om is a Bollywood film that captivates audiences with its unique blend of romance, drama, and a touch of nostalgia. Directed by Farah Khan and released in 2007, the movie serves as a tribute to the golden era of Indian cinema while also delivering a contemporary storyline that keeps viewers engrossed from start to finish.</p>
<p>The film revolves around the life of Om Prakash Makhija, played by Shah Rukh Khan, a junior artist with dreams of becoming a successful actor. Om's journey takes an unexpected turn when he crosses paths with the beautiful and enigmatic Shantipriya, portrayed by Deepika Padukone. Their fates intertwine, leading to a tragic incident that propels the story forward.</p>
<p>One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to transport the audience to the glitz and glamour of the 1970s Bollywood industry. The vibrant costumes, elaborate sets, and well-choreographed dance sequences pay homage to the era, evoking a sense of nostalgia for longtime Bollywood fans. Farah Khan's direction perfectly captures the essence of that period, enhancing the overall viewing experience.</p>
<p>The performances in Om Shanti Om are exceptional. Shah Rukh Khan effortlessly portrays the dual role of Om Prakash and Om Kapoor, showcasing his versatility as an actor. His charisma and charm bring depth to the character, making Om Prakash a relatable and lovable protagonist. Deepika Padukone shines in her debut role as Shantipriya, capturing both innocence and grace. The chemistry between Khan and Padukone is palpable, making their on-screen romance believable and heartfelt.</p>
<p>The film's soundtrack is a highlight, with catchy tunes that stay with you long after the movie ends. The iconic "Deewangi Deewangi" song, featuring a star-studded ensemble cast, is a testament to the film's celebration of Bollywood itself. The music, composed by Vishal-Shekhar, adds energy and emotion to the narrative, complementing the performances and enhancing the overall impact.</p>

<h3>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</h3>
<p>This is the movie that introduced me to the wonderful world of Indian Cinema.</p>
<p>I was 6 years old when I first saw Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and I instantly fell in love with it. I have since lost count of the number of times that I have watched it.</p>
<p>This was director Karan Johar's debut movie. Talk about starting of with a bang. This movie is perfection. It lives up to it's tag line. They'll make you laugh..They'll make you cry...They'll even make you fall in love. It made me do all of these things.</p>
<p>The songs are wonderful. The acting was fantastic. I love Kajol in this movie. She steals the show. I heard that Twinkle Khanna was actually considered as the first choice to play Anjali. That would have been the biggest mistake as I can't envision anyone else playing the role of Anjali besides Kajol.</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan was also good. He was less irritating back then. His performance actually had some soul behind it. Rani was the perfect choice for Tina.</p>
<p>Looking back at this movie now the only aspect that seems a bit redundant is the choreography. But you can't blame Farah Khan as things like dance moves revolutionizes with time.</p>
<p>On a whole this is a beautiful piece of cinema and all I can say to Karan Johar and his entire cast and crew is thank. Thank you for making Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and giving me and the world one of the greatest stories ever told.</p>

<h3>Hera Pheri</h3>
<p>An eternal classic by Priyadarshan. This is one of the best films ever made in Bollywood. I am a die hard fan of Hera Pheri. It makes you laugh so much and you won't feel bored even after several times of watching it. This movie did set the stage of stardom of Akshay Kumar as he got into comedy movies. Paresh Rawal is undoubtedly the best actor who delivered comedy with so much ease in one movie after another. The movie's iconic dialogues are going to stay with you for lifetime. Baburao Ganpatrao Apte is one of the best written characters performed by sublime Paresh Rawal. I would be thankful to Anand Vardhan and Neeraj Vora for writing such an outstanding movie.</p>
<p>Hera Pheri resonated with my childhood. I have watched it innumerable times. I miss those days when we used to fix our antennae to get the clarity and picture accurately on television. Yes, it belongs to that era. I do really miss to watch it on television nowadays and TV Channels broadcast all alike action packed hindi dubbed movies. I've made my mind that I'm going to download it and watch it on repeat. </p>
<p>That dialogue of Babu bhaiyya: "rakh halkat kutreya teri *** ** ", " devi ka prasad mndir me milega", "machli? Wo to mai, mast tel me fry kar ke khaa gya"  when he gets annoyed over the same phone call asking for Devi Prasad.<br />
That Om Puri ji's face when he goes to beat Shyam but eventually ends up helping him with the help of his sardarji friends. He says, " saale khud kamine ke paas khaane ke liye paise nahi hai aur yaha dekho kudi kharid raha hai"<br />
That Raju's dialogue "ab aaya na line pe" when Babu Bhaiyya asks him to cook rice.<br />
That pervert guy asks Asrani, "hume pata hai aap jaise logo ko bhi izzat se bulana padta hai."<br />
That Razzaq Khan's dialogue: "3 takle one 2 one 2"</p>
<p>There are innumerable dialogues of it that I do still remember very fondly and I can write it down. It would be better to visit "The Daily Hera Pheri meme project" on Twitter. You see, this is the fandom associated with the movie that someone has created a meme page on the movie's dialogues. Do visit it as it will tickle your funny bone and do watch the movie even if you've watched it.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
I've started to watch the movie again. There are hundreds of underrated moments in this movie which have not been acknowledged even on that meme page.<br>
For instance, Raju sings 'peele gagan me chale' when he is acting as if he is relieving himself of faeces (yellow in colour). The famous Hindi song is 'neele gagan ke tale' as the sky is blue.</p>
<p></p>The movie's song 'humba leela' emphasises the importance of spreading love irrespective of your financial status. It simply says that it's not sure whether we would live tomorrow or not so, as long as we are here we can always spread 'LOVE' and that is the wealth which all of us possess and whether what you can do or not, it can be done by you easily because you just need to be kind and you have to give love. It's easy and it's true.</p>

<h3>Devdas</h3>
<p>Ishhhh!!! What to speak about such a great Bollywood experience?? Just spellbound and speechless.... I am sure this is one of the so many best Bollywood films! So I am nowhere close enough to write the review of such a beautifully retold tale.....Anyways, here is my take.</p>
<p>Devdas is undoubtedly one of the best romances of Hindi Cinema. Beautifully retold, dramatically crafted, incredibly performed by Shah Rukh and impeccably directed by the very whole Sanjay Leela Bhansali.... Ishh!! What more could you ask for?? What is so special about our Bhansali's film is that he depicts emotions in such a dramatic way that you don't ever feel like turning your face away from the screen. Right from the very first frame, Bhansali makes sure you are glued to the screen. A mother rejoicing her son's homecoming-Ish! Such an incredible way of starting a film. And, if you are wondering why I am using this Ishhhhh so many times, you must watch the film.....</p>
<p>The sets are extravagant. The costumes exactly set the pace and mood of the film. The screenplay is so tight that you will not feel the film to be long even at one moment! The music is just extraordinary. Shreya's honey soaked renditions provide a completely charmimg experience. The direction, of course, Sanjay deserves a hats-off! The writing brings all that Shayari alive which are the dire need of such a dramatic film and perfectly jels with the direction and screenplay. The choreography is top-notch and steals your heart away. But, above all this, it is cinematography that takes the cake away!</p>
<p>Performances- Shah Rukh Khan delivers one of his finest performances. Aishwarya performs just about okay and excels in some portions. She looks a bit artificial which is not the right thing one looks out for. She is pretty. But the makeup could have been more original. The last sequence of the film shows one her acting prowess. Madhuri just excels as Chandramukhi and perfectly sets in her role. Her kathak learning helps her role and she outperforms Aishwarya in most of the sequences.</p>
<p>Ish! If you have not watched the film yet, watch it right away. You will experience one of the best films of Hindi Cinema. Hats off Bhansali! Thanks for bringing out a masterpiece yet again!!

<h3>Mohabbatein</h3>
<p>First off, this is by far a best SRK movie, and one of the best bollywood movie, as we see SRK for the first time in a mentor role, which I like, as we can feel his importance in the story without shoving him in our face because he is goddam shah ruhk khan. Secondly his performance was great mixing his kindspirit and drama that he is known for. I feel bad for him, when we learn his lover died, I actually cried when we learn what happen, and there are plot twists everywhere, left and right, some I did not know about. The music as always is great, I got to say there one of my favorites, my favorite especially was zinda rehti mhabbatein, as shah ruhk khan singing those lyrics were so powerful, good for him. Some problems with it are, there really isn't, the only problem is that it should have been longer, and the ending was so obvious, most bollywood movies always have happy endings, and this one was no different. Overall it's a good SRK film, and a good film in general. I can watch this over and over again, because it's that great of a film, I would reccommend this to bollywood, shah ruhk khan fans, or anyone who wants to get into these movies, or hate bollywood movies, this will for sure get them to watch more.</p>
